    <h3>Writer . Director . Producer</h3>
    <p>
        Director S.S. Rajamouli was already the most successful living filmmaker in his home country of India before audiences across the world became acquainted with him thanks to the crossover success of RRR. The period action film rode a wave of positive buzz on its way to an unprecedented Academy Award win in the Best Original Song category. The world seemingly his oyster, Rajamouli neither leaped on the Marvel bandwagon nor did he immediately begin cranking out an RRR sequel; instead, he’s been working quietly on an Indiana Jones-inspired movie made entirely in India. And this unpredictability is exactly what the upcoming documentary film Modern Masters: S.S. Rajamouli will attempt to unpack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The film received a first trailer recently, featuring testimonials from Rajamouli’s RRR stars Jr. NTR and Ram Charan, as well as the legendary James Cameron, and the star of his Baahubali films, Prabhas. While a significant amount of time is devoted to highlighting Rajamouli’s exuberance and artistic integrity, the trailer also hints at a more dictatorial side to his personality. “He’s a mad person,” says Prabhas, who attained stratospheric stardom following the success of the two Baahubali movies, and more recently with Kalki 2898 AD, which features Rajamouli in a quick cameo. “He’s a legend,” says director Karan Johar, who was perhaps the most recognizable Indian filmmaker among international audiences before Rajamouli came along.
